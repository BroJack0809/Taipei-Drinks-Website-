# How to Upload Your Taipei Drinks Project to GitHub

It seems your computer does not have "Git" installed, so the automatic script couldn't run. Don't worry! You have two simple options.

## Option 1: The "Drag & Drop" Method (No installation needed)
This is the easiest way if you don't want to install new software.

1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in.
   - Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
   - Name it (e.g., `taipei-drinks-2025`).
   - Click **Create repository**.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - On the setup page that appears, look for the link saying: **"uploading an existing file"**.
   - Or just go to your new repository page.
   - Open your project folder (`C:\Users\csie\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\taipei_drinks`) in Windows File Explorer.
   - Select ALL files (index.html, main.js, style.css, shops.json, README.md, etc.).
   - **Drag and drop** them directly onto the GitHub webpage.
   - Wait for the files to upload.

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" box.
   - In the message box, type: "Initial upload".
   - Click the green **Commit changes** button.

**Done!** Your website is now on GitHub.

## Option 2: Install Git (To use the automatic script)
If you prefer to use the `setup_github.bat` script or want to use Git in the future:

1. Download Git for Windows: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer and click "Next" through the default options.
3. **Important**: After installing, **restart your computer** (or at least close and reopen any command prompts) for the settings to take effect.
4. Try running `setup_github.bat` again.
